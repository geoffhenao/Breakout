# Breakout
Baby's first web-based game. I felt a spark to create something, so I spent a few hours following along with [MDN web docs]([(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript)]). v1 is very basic with three colors; however, I want to explore changing ball color with every brick hit within v2. For now, I'm very happy with how this turned out. Baby steps!
